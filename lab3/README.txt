Lab 3 write-up


Issues:
I used 2sc and bitmask to print the bits, I used most of my time to figure out how to read user input without syscall 5, but later found out that we are using program argument.


Useful commands:
I've found sll and srl very useful in loops.


Assembled code:
There were 6 more lines written by assembler, most of them were from la command or commands that contain constants, I guess it's because assembler needs to convert the value.
