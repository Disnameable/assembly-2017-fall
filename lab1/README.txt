I have the digit display in my PART D page. I connected those two input switches to a 5 input 8-segment LED, and connected two buttons (which were set to be 0 and shouldn¡¯t be pushed) to the remaining inputs on LED.

I¡¯ve read something familiar on a forum, and I guess the random number generator is not really random. It has some sort of irrational mathematical equation to simulate random, and some of the random generators take the system time of computer or user¡¯s keyboard input as seeds to make the result unpredictable.
